If you are wondering how to play Chuzzle Deluxe, here are some tips and tricks that can help you master the game. The basic rule of the game is to drag the rows or columns of Chuzzles to match three or more of the same color. When you do that, the Chuzzles will pop and disappear, and new ones will fall from the top. You can also create combos and chains by making multiple matches in a row or column. The more Chuzzles you pop, the more points you earn.
 
However, the game is not as easy as it sounds. There are some obstacles and challenges that you have to overcome as you play. For example, some Chuzzles are locked and cannot be moved until you free them by making a match with them. Some Chuzzles are explosive and will blow up if you don't pop them quickly. Some Chuzzles are sleepy and will fall asleep if you don't move them for a while. You have to be careful not to let the sleeping Chuzzles fill up the board, or else you will lose the game.
