Endodontic therapy, also known as root canal therapy, is a dental treatment for removing infection from inside a tooth. It can also protect the tooth from future infections. It is carried out when the pulp, the soft tissue inside the tooth, becomes inflamed or infected due to decay, injury, or repeated dental procedures[^2^]. Endodontic therapy can save a tooth that would otherwise have to be extracted, and restore its function and appearance.
